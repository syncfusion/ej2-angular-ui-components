            <ng-template #content>
                HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create
                web pages. Along
                with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create visually
                engaging web
                pages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. Web
                browsers can read
                HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website
                semantically
                along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.

                Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by Sun Microsystems, later acquired by
                Oracle Corporation,
                that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform
                computing environment.
                Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to
                enterprise servers
                and supercomputers. While less common, Java applets run in secure, sandboxed environments to provide
                many features
                of native applications and can be embedded in HTML pages.

                Xamarin is a San Francisco, California based software company created in May 2011[3] by the engineers
                that created Mono,[4]
                Mono for Android and MonoTouch that are cross-platform implementations of the Common Language
                Infrastructure (CLI)
                and Common Language Specifications (often called Microsoft .NET). With a C#-shared codebase, developers
                can use Xamarin
                tools to write native Android, iOS, and Windows apps with native user interfaces and share code across
                multiple platforms.[5]
                Xamarin has over 1 million developers in more than 120 countries around the World as of May 2015.

            </ng-template>
            <ng-template #content>
                ASP.NET is an open-source server-side web application framework designed for web development to produce
                dynamic web pages.
                It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications and web
                services.
                It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework, and is the successor to
                Microsoft\'\s
                Active Server Pages (ASP) technology. ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), allowing
                programmers
                to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language. The ASP.NET SOAP extension framework allows
                ASP.NET components
                to process SOAP messages.

                ASP.NET MVC
            </ng-template>
            <ng-template #content>
                The ASP.NET MVC is a web application framework developed by Microsoft, which implements the
                model–view–controller (MVC) pattern.
                It is open-source software, apart from the ASP.NET Web Forms component which is proprietary. In the
                later versions
                of ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and ASP.NET Web Pages (a platform using only Razor pages)
                will merge into
                a unified MVC 6.The project is called ASP.NET vNext.

            </ng-template>
            <ng-template #content>
                JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language. It was originally implemented as part
                of web browsers so
                that client-side scripts could interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously,
                and alter
                the document content that was displayed.[5] More recently, however, it has become common in both game
                development
                and the creation of desktop applications.
